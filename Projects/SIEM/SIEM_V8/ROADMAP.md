# Mini SOAR | Roadmap

## v8 (current) | UI tranche A + local/server seam + process context
* Top horizontal section nav | Dashboard, Tickets, Signals, Run
* Animated semi transparent left drawer | profile (name, email, avatar in localStorage), theme toggle, contacts
* Dark theme (locked) + light theme (Kibana style), saved in localStorage
* Animated ticket open/close, signals explanation accordion
* Palette | black/dark grey chrome, green accents, red buttons
  * Severity ramp | CRITICAL red -> HIGH orange -> MEDIUM yellow -> LOW green -> INFO grey
  * Category colors by source domain | windows, linux, ai, mail, web, server
* Click a type, MITRE code, or severity -> filtered Tickets view
* Browser back button works (History API), closed tickets dimmed
* Closed-ticket signals hidden in the Signals view
* File hash click -> copy only. Signal ID click -> copy (search it in Tickets)
* File browser (/api/browse) | free in local mode, confined in server mode
* /api/run-stream | --out-dir + whitelisted format
* MODE seam | SIEM_MODE=local|server fixed at launch (run_local.bat | run_server.bat)
* Process context | each signal now carries process_ancestors and process_children
  (enriched: image, pid, ppid, command_line, event_id, host). Attached post-merge
  from the ProcessTree. Front display of this data is the next front task.

## v9 | multi format ingestion
* pcap/Wireshark, evtx, auditd, elastic/ECS, snort, csv (dropdown stubs already present)
* live local log capture agent

## v10 | multi user / server mode
* accounts, authentication, roles and permissions
* ticket transfer between operators (assignee field already exists)
* Kanban board, Contacts directory with privilege levels
* Gmail / Outlook OAuth (read only)

## v11 | reach
* responsive mobile layout
* English / French i18n

## Showcase (post v10) | public portfolio demo
* read-only hosted demo, preloaded test JSON, not downloadable, code not exposed
* a third "demo" mode distinct from local and server (no writes, frozen dataset)

## Open items
* powershell_sigma.py lines 438-440 | three French advisory strings keep accents.
  Decide: keep, strip to ASCII, or translate to English.
* clipboard copy needs a secure context | works on http://localhost, blocked on plain
  http:// over a network IP. Relevant when v10 server mode is served on a LAN.
* current bash sample data has no pid/ppid linkage, so ancestry shows empty there;
  a sysmon-like dataset with real process events populates it.
